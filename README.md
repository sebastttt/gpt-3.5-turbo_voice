**Voice-enabled Conversational Agent using OpenAI's GPT-3 Language Model**

This is a Python script that allows you to have a conversation with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model using your voice. 
The script records your voice input, sends it to OpenAI's GPT-3 model, and returns the response text which is spoken aloud to you using text-to-speech technology.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
openai
keyboard
speech_recognition
pyttsx3
requests

**Installation**
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages using pip:
Copy code
pip install openai keyboard speechrecognition pyttsx3 requests
Set up an OpenAI API key. Follow the instructions in the OpenAI API documentation to create an account and generate an API key.
Copy and paste your API key into the openai.api_key variable in the script.

**Usage**
Run the script using a Python interpreter:
Copy code
python voice_agent.py
Press any key to start speaking into your microphone.
Wait for the script to speak the response from OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.
Press 'esc' to stop the program.

**Customization**
You can customize the language model used by modifying the model parameter in the get_response() function.
You can customize the keyboard input to start recording your voice by modifying the key specified in the keyboard.wait() function.
You can customize the language used for speech recognition by modifying the language parameter in the r.recognize_google() function.

**Note**
The script uses Google's speech recognition API to convert your voice input into text. Make sure you have a stable internet connection and check the speech recognition language settings in the r.recognize_google() function.
The script uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model, which requires an API key. Make sure you have a valid API key and replace it in the script's openai.api_key variable.
